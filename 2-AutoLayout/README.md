# Episode #2. Auto Layout

In this episode, we will introduce Auto Layout.

Using Auto Layout, we can design the user interface using a series of constraints, which are Position, Size, and Align.

Constraints typically represent a relationship between two views. Auto Layout then calculates the size and location of each view based on these constraints.
