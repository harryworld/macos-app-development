# Episode #1. Storyboards

In this episode, we will start with some basics. The first topic is Storyboard. If you are iOS developer, this should be familiar to you.

Using Storyboards, we can build the basic app flow, navigation and so on, without writing one line of code. Today, we will start making the app by dragging some components to the Storyboard.
